# üóÑÔ∏è Project Structure

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks something like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- album-shelf               # main application layer
|
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # global configurations, exported env variables etc.
|
+-- lib               # reusable libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- providers         # all providers used
|
+-- test              # test utilities and mocks
|
+-- types             # shared types used across the application
```

The Album Shelf is the main and only feature of this application. In bigger projects, code should be organized within a features folder.

For the sake of this challenge, the Album Shelf is treated as a standalone feature, as shown

```sh
album-shelf
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types used within the feature
```

Each feature folder should contain code specific to that feature, keeping things neatly separated. This approach helps prevent mixing feature-related code with shared components, making it simpler to manage and maintain the codebase compared to having many files in a flat folder structure.

A feature could have the following structure:

```sh
src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types used within the feature
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
```
