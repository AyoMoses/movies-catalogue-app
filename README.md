# Release Note

The application has been bootstrapped using `Vite` and its `react-ts` template.

The application is relatively simple. Users can explore the catalog of albums by filtering albums through text search, sorting albums by Album Name, Release Date and Total Tracks respectively, and transversing through the paginated albums collection using infinite scrolling.
